 ## What are AI "second brains"

Pinning down the exact delineations between the various emerging tools, combining the power of large language models with RAG, is challenging. 

The functionality of stock LLMs can be enhanced (at the time of writing) by:

- Providing them access to proprietary / private / curated data sources  
- Providing them access to real time data sources. 
- Enhancing them by providing them with tools to interact with APIs thereby enabling an almost infinite universe of control use cases (see: MCP also).  
  
The problem is that the exact terminologies are still a bit muddy. What's the difference between an AI "agent" and an AI "assistant"? And what exactly is an AI "second brain".

The borderline isn't fixed. Any agentic tool that leverages RAG (that's all of them!) can integrate functionalities to enable agents to interact usefully with the vectorized data stores. But the type of data store envisioned in this connected use case revealed some major differences:

- Enterprises might be primarily interested in connecting their agents to fast growing and fast changing stores of business data. 
- Tools focused around more knowledge centric use-cases place a higher precedence on making it easy for users to uploaded knowledge into the vector storage - because the ingestion of such data is more likely to be deliberate than automated. 

Doing the latter involves abstracting the complications of embedding and committing to vector storage Data that begins its life in conventional digital formats. Platforms that do this superlatively well, and which provide easy access to these contact storages to the agents deployed within their platforms, frequently market themselves as being "AI digital brains". The above is my definition only!

## Other Nomenclature

Some ideas for the emerging terminologies to describe the application of RAG for personal use - Leveraging smaller and more curated batches of context data in order to increase personalization and the usefulness of inference:

- Personal context augmented LLMs
- Personalised LLMs
- Personal RAG systems

## Personal Context / LLM Personalisation Tools vs. "Speak To Your Docs"

Although it might seem like splitting hairs, there is another definite division between tools which are focused on my primary interest (achieving hyper personalized large language model agent workflows through adding personal context data) and those which market themselves as "speak to your docs" (speak to your PDF, etc).

There is so much crossover in terms of features that speak to your document type. Tools can be used to simply for the purpose of bringing in context data (after all, that's recorded in docs!). But there are some specific features which would be more likely to be seen in the personal context use case - for example, the ability to create "documents" within the tool rather than to just pull it in and index it passively.
